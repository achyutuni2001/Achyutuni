# Building Systems That Scale

I design software with a **systems mindset** — prioritizing architecture, reliability, and long-term maintainability over quick prototypes.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Intelligent backend services  
- Retrieval-augmented systems  
- Agent orchestration  
- Cloud-native infrastructure  
- Production-grade APIs  

I care deeply about writing software that is **observable, extensible, and built for real usage.**

# Selected Work

## MeetAI — Agentic Meeting Platform *(In Progress)*  
**Next.js • TypeScript • SaaS Architecture • AI Agents**

A modern meeting platform where AI is treated as infrastructure rather than a feature.

Designed around modular agents capable of summarization, knowledge capture, and workflow automation — enabling meetings to become searchable, actionable systems.

---

## AgentForge — Engineering AI Agents as First-Class Systems  
**Google ADK • FastAPI • Clean Architecture**

An architectural exploration into treating agents like backend services instead of experimental scripts.

Focus areas include:

- interface-driven design  
- orchestration layers  
- observability  
- composability

---

## AskDB — Natural Language Interface for Databases  
**LangChain • Structured Prompting • Query Execution**

Transforms plain English questions into executable SQL while remaining schema-aware.

Built to reduce friction between humans and structured data.

---

## F1GPT — Retrieval-Based AI System  
**LangChain.js • Vector Retrieval • Next.js**

A RAG-powered assistant that answers Formula 1 queries using curated knowledge sources and a clean retrieval pipeline.

# Engineering Philosophy

Great systems are not accidental.

They are designed with intention —  
clear boundaries, strong abstractions, and respect for scale.

I aim to build software that remains understandable long after it ships.
