## 🧠 About

I build intelligent systems with a strong focus on backend architecture, scalability, and reliability. While I work across the stack, my core interest lies in designing APIs, distributed services, and AI-powered platforms that solve practical problems.

I’m particularly drawn to agentic workflows, retrieval-based systems, and cloud-native infrastructure, and I enjoy turning complex ideas into software that is clear, durable, and ready for real-world use.

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

Great systems are intentional, they emerge from clear boundaries, strong abstractions, and an obsession with clarity.

I aim to build software that remains understandable and reliable as it grows.
